Spring task scheduling example from the *Pro Spring 5* book ported to Kotlin and Postgres.

## Install PostgreSQL

On Debian Linux, PostgreSQL can be installed with the following command:

```bash
# apt-get install postgresql postgresql-doc
```

Both the default database user and default database are called postgres

## Create a user and database for the system user

By default, Postgres uses a concept called “roles” to handle authentication and authorization.
After installation Postgres is set up to use ident authentication, meaning that it associates Postgres roles with a matching Unix/Linux system account.

Use su to switch to the postgres acount and create a user with the same name as the system user:

```
$ su -
# su -s /bin/bash postgres
postgres@debian:/root$ createuser -s username
```
The -s option grants superuser privileges.

Next we need to create a database for the user:

```bash
postgres@debian:/root$ createdb -O username username
```

Now try to start psql as a normal user:

```bash
$ psql
username=# \q
```

## Create cars user and database

After setting up a user for the local system user, we no longer need to switch to the postgres account to run postgres commands.
Add an instagram postgres user:

```bash
$ createuser -P cars
```

This creates an cars user that is not allowed to create new databases or roles and is not superuser. The -P flag will display a password prompt to set a password for the user.

To create the cars database, run the follwing command:

```bash
$ createdb -O cars cars
```

## Create tables

The Spring Hibernate example will automatically create tables before running the test and drop them after running the tests.
It will also add test data to the tables.

## Runnig tests

Before running tests, set the correct password in `src/main/resources/db/jdbc.properties`. `SingerDaoTest` will test CRUD operations.
